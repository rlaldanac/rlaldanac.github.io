            <b>“The authorities were not interested in the people willing to buy. They were only interested in the people willing to sell. The people who were contacting us regarding buying votes were definitely 50 to 70% from the two different candidates’ campaigns, or people that were funding these campaigns. Those were very commercial claims of interest, and not individuals.” —UBERMORGEN </b>

                Vote-auction instructed vote sellers to send their absentee ballots to the website. This process was a flagged as a violation of the State of Illinois election code that requires absentee voters, under penalty of perjury, to mark their ballots in secret. In addition, the fact that ballots were sent to the administrators of <i>Vote-Auction</i> was also a violation of a statute that mandates that all absentee ballots must be sent directly to the board of election comissioners.
