            UBERMORGEN shows the totality of all original documents from the legal proceedings, a total of 700kg worth of court documents, injunctions and such, in exhibitions worldwide. <br><br>
			These documents are refered to as forginals, a cheeky combination of the words forged and original. For UBERMORGEN this combination of fact and fiction shows the expansion of one's perception of concepts such as <b>RIGHTS</b>, <b>DEMOCRACY</b> and <b>GLOBAL COMMUNICATION</b>.
			<br><br> <i>Vote-Auction</i> has been exhibited in this manner in places ranging from the Lentos Kunstmuseum in Linz, Austria, to the Eyebeam here in New York City.
