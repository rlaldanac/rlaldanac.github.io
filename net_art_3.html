            The Vote Auction website is still up and running, although it has not been changed in the last 20 years
			<br>
			<br>
			Vote-Auction allows users to view the statistics of the "bidders" and results of the bidding
			<br>
			<br>
			The Vote-Auction website even has fake ads running on the bottom of the page
        </p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 18px;">
                Vote Auction contains a brief history of the US "Election Market" which highlights several cases of money being used to sway US elections
				<br>
				<br>
				It would be interesting to see what it would be like if this website updated over the past 20 years as there have been many more cases of "bought" elections and even voter fraud.
				<br>
				<br>
				Seeing as this website was made before the 2000 election it had no knowledge of the scandal that would follow, and no doubt the circumstances around that election also contributed to the increased legal scrutiny around this website
