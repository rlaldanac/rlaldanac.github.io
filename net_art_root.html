		<p class="paragraph_1"> <br>Vote-Auction was an online auction platform created during the 2000 US presidential election that claimed to allow Americans to sell their vote online
			<br>
			 
			<br>
			Wasn't a real marketplace so actual sales took place, but that didn't stop them from running into legal troubles
			<br>
			 
			<br>
			Vote-Auction worked to raise questions about the morality of law and the opacity of democratic institutions under capitalism.
