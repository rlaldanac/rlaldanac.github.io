        At lunchtime I bought a huge orange <br>
        The size of it made us all laugh. <br>
        I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave - <br>
        They got quarters and I had half. <br>
        <br>
        And that orange it made me so happy, <br>
        As ordinary things often do <br>
        Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park <br>
        This is peace and contement. It's new. <br>
        <br>
        The rest of the day was quite easy. <br>
        I did all my jobs on my list <br>
        And enjoyed them and had some time over. <br>
        I love you. I'm glad I exist.
