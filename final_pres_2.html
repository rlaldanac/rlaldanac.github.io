    <p class="paragraph_1"> &emsp; When our lives revolve around someone, they don’t just stop doing so even if all that’s left is some semblance of their memory. There are always those bits that linger. The memories that are impressed on the places you went and the things you said and the songs you listened to remain.
        <br>
        <br>
        We all eventually find ourselves standing in the checkout line, hearing one of those songs come on and realizing that we’re revolving around them again. And maybe we never stopped.</p>

            &emsp; I found various points in the essay that made me want to expand on these ideas, and I think it would provide an interesting challenge to switch from a medium I'm familiar with to expressing an idea through web development
            <br>
            <br>
            This website will allow the reader to interact with it as much as or as little as they want to
            <br>
            <br>
            The user could simply read the marked up essay, or click all the buttons and explore every idea and thought put into the website     
            <br>
            <br>
            That way each user could potentially have a different experience with the website
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph_2">
            I want to implement various hyperlinks to mini-websites that highlight the thought in a particular line, or add in a different perspective on the idea, as well as buttons that allow the user to change the essay and/or provide a visiual representation of the thought
