	<center><h1>How The People We Once Loved Become Strangers Again</h1></center>
    <p class="paragraph_1"> &emsp; I want to believe that you either love someone, in some way, forever, or you never really loved them at all. That once two reactive chemicals cross both are changed. That the wounds we leave in people are sometimes too raw to risk falling back into them. I don’t want to believe that we write each other off because we simply don’t matter anymore. I know love isn’t expendable. I wonder, and maybe hope, if we ever just force it to be out of necessity. </p>

        &emsp; I think the subject matter is something a lot of people find relatable and will want to either sit with or reflect on the impact it might have had on them.

        As such this website will allow the user to share their thoughts and document their own feelings
        <br>
        <br>
        There will be a page with just the essay for the user to mark up on their own
        <br>
        <br>
        And a page for the user to either write down their thoughts, or sketch something
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph_2">
        I especially want whatever the user adds to be impermanent, a way for the user to scream into the void so to speak. I think it is important to sometimes not share (or even delete) your art.
        <br>
        And with the nature of this essay I think it could be especially attractive to users to be able to do and say whatever they want without fear of others seeing it
