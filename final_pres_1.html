        <p style="font-size: 25px;", class="paragraph_1"> &emsp; It’s interesting to think about how we make people who used to be everything into nothing again. How we learn to forget. How we force forgetting. What we put in place of them in the interim. The dynamics afterward always tell you more than what the relationship did – grief is a faster teacher than joy – but what does it mean when you cycle out to being strangers again? You never really stop knowing each other in that way. Maybe there’s no choice but to make them someone different in your mind, not the person who knew your daily anxieties and what you looked like naked and what made you cry and how much you loved them.

            &emsp; How The People We Once Loved Become Strangers Again is an essay by Brianna Wiest found in 101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think, I found it deeply interesting and immediately found myself wanting to mark it up

            <br>
			 
			<br>
			I only had a digital copy of the book, so I copied the essay into google docs and began to mark it up there
            <br>
			 
			<br>
            This led to me to think about how much more you could add to a work of art using the tools we've learned in class
		</p>
	</div>
	<p class="paragraph_2">
				I've decided to make a net art piece that allows the user not only to read the essay but see visual mark ups, and further explore the impact the essay might have by utilizing various tools we've learned in class </p>
