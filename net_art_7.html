            As a response to the somewhat controverial and illegal court orders sent from the US to Europe, UBERMORGEN created the <i>Injunction generator</i>.
			<br><br> This software module was designed to create an interface on which one can create their own cease-and-desist requests and other legal injunctions.

                In the year 2004 UBERMORGEN released a project called <i>*THE*AGENCY</i> designed for manual elction recount. This became the 2nd part of what has now come to be known as the Election Trilogy.
				<br><br> The third part of the trilogy came in 2007 in the form of <i>WAHLGELD.COM</i>. This platform was designed as a space for vote-buying and selling within the context of Swiss parliamentary election. The Swiss election commission decreed that this project was non-commercial in motivation.
